## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to remove the scroll button in number input, allow users to enter only numbers in a text input field.

### Continued development

The project would have taken less time if I used Jquery. But I am trying to improve my JS skills, so that's why I am trying to build all the projects using only vanilla JS.
